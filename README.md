# Push-Relabel-Algorithm-Parallelisation
Parallel implementations of the Push-Relabel algorithm using CUDA, MPI, and OpenMP to solve the maximum flow problem efficiently. Each version explores different models of parallelism—GPU acceleration, distributed memory, and shared memory—for performance comparison and scalability.
